‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction
pdfrip is a fast multithreaded PDF password cracking utility written in Rust with support for wordlist based dictionary attacks, date and number range bruteforcing, and a custom query builder for password formats.


Features
Fast: Performs about 50k-100k+ passwords per second utilising full CPU cores.
Custom Query Builder: You can write your own queries like STRING{69-420} which would generate and use a wordlist with the full number range.
Date Bruteforce: You can pass in a year which would bruteforce all 365 days of the year in DDMMYYYY format which is a pretty commonly used password format for PDFs.
Number Bruteforce: Just give a number range like 5000-100000 and it would bruteforce with the whole range.
Installation
$ curl -L https://github.com/mufeedvh/pdfrip/releases/download/v1.0.0/pdfrip_amd64 -o pdfrip
(Linux AMD x86-64)

OR

Download the executable from Releases for your OS.

OR

Install with cargo:

$ cargo install --git https://github.com/mufeedvh/pdfrip.git
Install Rust/Cargo

Build From Source
Prerequisites:

Git
Rust
Cargo (Automatically installed when installing Rust)
A C linker (Only for Linux, generally comes pre-installed)
$ git clone https://github.com/mufeedvh/pdfrip.git
$ cd pdfrip/
$ cargo build --release
The first command clones this repository into your local machine and the last two commands enters the directory and builds the source in release mode.

Usage
Get a list of all the arguments:

$ pdfrip --help
Start a dictionary attack with a wordlist:

$ pdfrip -f encrypted.pdf wordlist rockyou.txt
Bruteforce number ranges for the password:

$ pdfrip -f encrypted.pdf range 1000 9999
Bruteforce all dates in a year for the password in DDMMYYYY format:

$ pdfrip -f encrypted.pdf date 1999
Build a custom query to generate a wordlist: (useful when you know the password format)

$ pdfrip -f encrypted.pdf custom-query ALICE{1000-9999}

$ pdfrip -f encrypted.pdf custom-query DOC-ID{0-99}-FILE
Enable preceding zeros for custom queries: (which would make {10-5000} to {0010-5000} matching the end range's digits)

$ pdfrip -f encrypted.pdf custom-query ALICE{10-9999} --add-preceding-zeros
